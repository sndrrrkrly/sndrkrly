**Hey, I'm SÃ¡ndor! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm 18, a self-taught developer based in Hungary. 
I've been obsessed with computers since I was little. 
I love learning new technologies- and programming languages, and also I love tinkering with new ideas and turning them 
into full-size products with the goal to make people's days a little better.

I also make [Saiss](https://github.com/sndrkrly/saiss), a fast, minimal browser that protects your privacy, and [inkHouse](https://github.com/sndrkrly/inkhouse), a voice-talk-only social network platform of the future (hopefully). 
I like open-sourcing projects, or contributing to other open-source projects.

If I'm not coding or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/visionbysndr), I probably draw or read because I love both!
