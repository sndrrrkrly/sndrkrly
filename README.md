Hi, I'm <b>Sandor</b>, <br>
I'm 17, from Hungary. 👨🏻‍💻 <br>
Student & self-taught programmer <br>
I’ve been obsessed with computers since I was little, <br> and worked with software for the past 5 years 🧪 <br>
<br>
I love learning new technologies- and programming languages, <br> and also I love tinkering with new ideas and turning them <br> into full-size products with the goal to make people’s days a little better. 
<br>
(Otherwise avid motion graphics, and video editing.)
